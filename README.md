## Log Book for my game:

# On November 16th
-> I noticed something was wrong with my GitHub account,
   as the commits I am pushing from my Ubuntu terminal are not showing up in my
   profile calendar. I can see those commits in my GitHub repository.

# On November 17th
-> Github profile calendar is finally working and I can see my commits
   on the calendar as well as on the repository.

-> Although I am busy because of my pending client projects and my final exams.
   I still manage to make time for learning bash, Because I love programming so much

-> Today I was planning ti add a load screen using text and symbols that terminal has
   inside my game and my programs. So I added a different program in my repository that
   has the code for my oading screen but it is generated by ChatGpt.

-> Firstly I was planning to add the loading screen by myself but for that I had to
   learn so many concepts, I learned a little then I realised it will take a lot of
   time this way so i just Used AI to see the syntax and all.

-> That is the reason I did not added the loading screen directly into my game program
   because it was not written by me. When I finally learn to make one by my self, Then
   then I will integrate inside my game program as well.

# Thankyou
