## Log Book for my game:

### On November 16th
-> I noticed something was wrong with my GitHub account,  
   as the commits I am pushing from my Ubuntu terminal are not showing up in my  
   profile calendar. I can see those commits in my GitHub repository.

### On November 17th
-> GitHub profile calendar is finally working, and I can see my commits  
   on the calendar as well as in the repository.

-> Although I am busy with my pending client projects and final exams,  
   I still manage to make time for learning Bash because I love programming so much.

-> Today I was planning to add a loading screen using text and symbols that the terminal has  
   inside my game and my programs. So I added a different program to my repository that  
   has the code for my loading screen, but it was generated by ChatGPT.

-> Initially, I was planning to add the loading screen by myself, but for that, I had to  
   learn so many concepts. I learned a little and then realized it would take a lot of  
   time this way, so I just used AI to see the syntax and all.

-> That is why I did not add the loading screen directly into my game program,  
   because it was not written by me. When I finally learn to make one by myself,  
   then I will integrate it into my game program as well.

### On November 18th
-> Tomorrow is my final exam of Computer programming, so today I am going to spend most of my time
   preparing for it.

### On November 19th
-> Gave my final exam if Computer programming today, Could not do much of bash today but might do some at night.

-> Okay so learnt some bash and implemented it in a seperate file inside the this repository.

### On November 20th
-> Could not do anything today, just studied for my exam which is tomorrow.

-> Okay so I was actually able to do something today, I acted a banner at the start of 
   my game to improve the interface.

### On November 21st
-> Learnt about things like figlet and added a text banner in beginning of my game interface, a loading screen and also
   improved the over-all functionality of it.

### On November 22nd
-> Mostly studied for my tomorrow's math exam. 

-> And managed to learn about ascii art and how to implement it in the terminal
   I was planning to add it in my game but, Atleast rn i feel like it will ruin the aesthetics of the game.
   Also, I am not sure how I can implement it in my game code.

-> Today I worked on the gameplay part of my game code and added some code lines for input and ouput, I am 

   trying to make it interesting and unique.

### On November 23rd
-> Just gave my exam and did some work after that, nothing special
-> Lost my commit streak today, sadly.

### On November 24th
-> Mostly worked today, going to work again after updating my log book, really busy now a days.
