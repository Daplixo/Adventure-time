## Log Book for my game:

### On November 16th
-> I noticed something was wrong with my GitHub account, as the commits I am pushing from my Ubuntu terminal are not showing up in my profile calendar. I can see those commits in my GitHub repository.

### On November 17th
-> GitHub profile calendar is finally working, and I can see my commits on the calendar as well as in the repository.

-> Although I am busy with my pending client projects and final exams, I still manage to make time for learning Bash because I love programming so much.

-> Today I was planning to add a loading screen using text and symbols that the terminal has inside my game and my programs. So I added a different program to my repository that has the code for my loading screen, but it was generated by ChatGPT.

-> Initially, I was planning to add the loading screen by myself, but for that, I had to learn so many concepts. I learned a little and then realized it would take a lot of time this way, so I just used AI to see the syntax and all.

-> That is why I did not add the loading screen directly into my game program, because it was not written by me. When I finally learn to make one by myself, then I will integrate it into my game program as well.

### On November 18th
-> Tomorrow is my final exam of Computer Programming, so today I am going to spend most of my time preparing for it.

### On November 19th
-> Gave my final exam in Computer Programming today. Could not do much of Bash today but might do some at night.

-> Okay, so I learned some Bash and implemented it in a separate file inside this repository.

### On November 20th
-> Could not do anything today, just studied for my exam which is tomorrow.

-> Okay, so I was actually able to do something today. I added a banner at the start of my game to improve the interface.

### On November 21st
-> Learned about things like `figlet` and added a text banner in the beginning of my game interface, a loading screen, and also improved the overall functionality of it.

### On November 22nd
-> Mostly studied for my tomorrow's math exam.

-> Managed to learn about ASCII art and how to implement it in the terminal. I was planning to add it to my game, but at least right now I feel like it will ruin the aesthetics of the game. Also, I am not sure how I can implement it in my game code.

-> Today I worked on the gameplay part of my game code and added some code lines for input and output. I am trying to make it interesting and unique.

### On December 14th
-> It's 1 am, and I am determined to make huge progress in my projects and finish all of them before 2025.
